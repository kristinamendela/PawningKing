# Pawning King
Tycoon business game built by Ian King, Connor Keohane, and Kristina Mendela

(Pending Kristina putting the entire project up on the GitHub)


INSTRUCTIONS FOR NOW UNTIL THE WHOLE PROJECT IS UP:
Create a new Unity file named 'Pawning King' using Unity version 2020 and copy the 'asset' folder 
into the project in order to overwrite the current 'asset' folder.


This include all the assets and scenes from the 'Pawning King' game.

When making changes, we only need to change the 'assets' folder.

Then, follow the instructions in the 'test' file to learn how to push/pull to/from
GitHub.

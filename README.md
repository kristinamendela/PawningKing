# Pawning King
Tycoon business game built by Ian King, Connor Keohane, and Kristina Mendela


INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a new Unity file named PawningKing using Unity version 2020 and copy the 'asset' folder 
into the project in order to overwrite the current 'asset' folder.

This include all the assets and scenes from the PawningKing game.

There are too many files to upload to entire Unity projet to GitHub, so that's why there is only
the 'assets' folder. 

Then, follow the instructions in the 'test' file to learn how to push/pull from/to
GitHub.
